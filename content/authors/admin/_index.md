Sebastian Schneider studied Bioinformatics, Genome Research and Intelligent Systems at Bielefeld University, University of Helsinki and Aalto University. He received a B.Sc in Bioinformatics and Genome Research in 2009 and an M.Sc. in Intelligent Systems in 2011. Sebastian Schneider stayed in 2010  at Aldebaran Robotics in Paris to work on noise reduction techniques for embedded speech recognition systems. In his Master's thesis, he investigated the effects of different assistive robot feedback strategies on participants during cognitive stress.  After completing his Master's degree, he joined the Applied Informatics Group and worked on the SocialRobots project on socially assistive robots to promote physical activity for long-term space missions.
He was a Ph.D. student at the CITEC Graduate School and was supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Franz Kummert. He is interested in Human-Robot Interaction with a focus on socially assistive scenarios. In his research, he investigated the influence of feedback, embodiment and companionship of robots on a user's motivation to exercise. He investigated how the presence and the feedback of a robot can boost the performance of humans. Thus, his work combines research in social psychology, sports science, and computer science.
Further, he wants to explored how a system can interactively learn a user's preference and adapt to the user's task desires in sports scenarios. To investigate how online preference learning can be used in HRI, he adopted  different bandit learning algorithms and evaluated the feasibility for real-time interaction and preference learning. He proposed that a personalized exercising program with a social robot will increase the engagement of the user to interact with such a system and will influence the working alliance. 
Currently, he works as a post-doc at the Applied Informatics group. He teaches seminars and lectures on social robots, social user interfaces, ethical and social aspects of intelligent systems and socially and rehabilitative assistive robotics. In his current research he looks at personalization mechanisms for enhancing user experience, robot skill learning by exploiting comparative human judgement, human-robot handover under visual impairment and detection of human exhaustion during exercising based on facial expressions.
